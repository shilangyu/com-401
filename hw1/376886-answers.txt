Q2a_m="HEARD A LITTLE ANIMAL (SHE COULDNT GUESS OF WHAT SORT IT WAS) SCRATCHING AND SCRAMBLING ABOUT IN THE CHIMNEY CLOSE ABOVE HER: THEN, SAYING TO HERSELF THIS IS BILL, SHE GAVE ONE SHARP KICK, AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT.  THE FIRST THING SHE HEARD WAS A GENERAL CHORUS OF THERE GOES BILL! THEN THE RABBITS VOICE ALONG--CATCH HIM, YOU BY THE HEDGE! THEN SILENCE, AND THEN ANOTHER CONFUSION OF VOICES--HOLD UP HIS HEAD--BRANDY NOW--DONT CHOKE HIM--HOW WAS IT, OLD FELLOW? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? TELL US ALL ABOUT IT!  LAST CAME A LITTLE FEEBLE, SQUEAKING VOICE, (THATS BILL, THOUGHT ALICE,) WELL, I HARDLY KNOW--NO MORE, THANK YE; IM BETTER NOW--BUT IM A DEAL TOO FLUSTERED TO TELL YOU--ALL I KNOW IS, SOMETHING COMES AT ME LIKE A JACK-IN-THE-BOX, AND UP I GOES LIKE A SKY-ROCKET!  SO YOU DID, OLD FELLOW! SAID THE OTHERS.  WE MUST BURN THE HOUSE DOWN! SAID THE RABBITS VOICE; AND ALICE CALLED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD, IF YOU DO. ILL SET DINAH AT YOU!  THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE INSTANTLY, AND ALICE THOUGHT TO HERSELF, I WONDER WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT! IF THEY HAD ANY SENSE, THEYD TAKE THE ROOF OFF. AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO, THEY BEGAN MOVING ABOUT AGAIN, AND ALICE HEARD THE RABBIT SAY, A BARR"
Q2b_m="GOING TO DO THAT IN A HURRY. NO, ILL LOOK FIRST, SHE SAID, AND SEE WHETHER ITS MARKED "POISON" OR NOT; FOR SHE HAD READ SEVERAL NICE LITTLE HISTORIES ABOUT CHILDREN WHO HAD GOT BURNT, AND EATEN UP BY WILD BEASTS AND OTHER UNPLEASANT THINGS, ALL BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT REMEMBER THE SIMPLE RULES THEIR FRIENDS HAD TAUGHT THEM: SUCH AS, THAT A RED-HOT POKER WILL BURN YOU IF YOU HOLD IT TOO LONG; AND THAT IF YOU CUT YOUR FINGER VERY DEEPLY WITH A KNIFE, IT USUALLY BLEEDS; AND SHE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT, IF YOU DRINK MUCH FROM A BOTTLE MARKED POISON, IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO DISAGREE WITH YOU, SOONER OR LATER.  HOWEVER, THIS BOTTLE WAS NOT MARKED POISON, SO ALICE VENTURED TO TASTE IT, AND FINDING IT VERY NICE, (IT HAD, IN FACT, A SORT OF MIXED FLAVOUR OF CHERRY-TART, CUSTARD, PINE-APPLE, ROAST TURKEY, TOFFEE, AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST,) SHE VERY SOON FINISHED IT OFF.  WHAT A CURIOUS FEELING! SAID ALICE; I MUST BE SHUTTING UP LIKE A TELESCOPE.  AND SO IT WAS INDEED: SHE WAS NOW ONLY TEN INCHES HIGH, AND HER FACE BRIGHTENED UP AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS NOW THE RIGHT SIZE FOR GOING THROUGH THE LITTLE DOOR INTO THAT LOVELY GARDEN. FIRST, HOWEVER, SHE WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF SHE WAS"
